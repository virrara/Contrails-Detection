## üåç Abstract  
The consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly urgent, with contrails (condensation trails) identified as potential contributors to this phenomenon. This study tackles the challenge of detecting contrails in satellite imagery by employing advanced deep learning models and band selection strategies.  

Using the **Landsat-8 dataset** with human-labeled contrails sourced from the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager, the study evaluates the effectiveness of various deep learning models:  
- **DeepLabV3**  
- **U-Net**  
- **Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)**  
- **Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNET2)**  
- **Ensemble Deep Learning**  

Additionally, we explored the impact of specific band combinations, such as the ash color scheme using **Bands 11, 14, 15, and 08**, on improving contrail identification.

## Key Findings  
- The **FCN model with Band 08** achieved the best performance, showing the **lowest average loss** during training (0.032591) and validation (0.013321).  
- Incorporating **Band 08** did not universally enhance performance but proved effective for specific models.  
- Results highlight the importance of model selection and band configuration for detecting contrails with greater precision.
